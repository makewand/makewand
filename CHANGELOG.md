## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Quota-aware routing / 配额感知路由.** Routing now reads each subscription's
  remaining usage (5-hour session window + weekly cap) and steers work toward the
  pool with headroom before a cap is hit.
  - Predicted headroom is a *soft* signal — a near-limit pool is deprioritized in
    candidate ranking (new `QuotaBand` sort key, orthogonal to the Thompson
    quality score) but never removed, so quota prediction alone cannot cause a
    routing failure.
  - Confirmed exhaustion (a real quota/429 error) *hard-blocks* the pool at the
    execution boundary until its window resets.
  - `makewand quota` (with `--json`) shows the current picture per provider.
  - Data is read locally or via already-stored credentials (Claude OAuth usage
    endpoint, Codex session logs, agy login state); nothing is uploaded, and an
    unreadable source degrades to neutral.
  - Quota reads are cached to disk (`~/.cache/makewand/quota-snapshot.json`,
    120s TTL) and shared across processes, so repeated invocations don't re-hit
    the rate-limited usage endpoints; a stale cache still serves as last-good
    when a source is momentarily unavailable. 429-seals are never persisted.
  - Disabled by default for library embedders: `NewRouterFromConfig` is quota-free
    unless `RouterConfig.Quota` is set.
- **Antigravity CLI (`agy`) support.** Personal Gemini subscriptions now route
  through `agy` (the successor to the retired individual `gemini` CLI OAuth). When
  installed, `agy` takes the Gemini provider slot automatically; `MAKEWAND_AGY_MODEL`
  overrides the model.

### Changed

- The metered `gemini -p` path is now a fallback used only when `agy` is not
  installed, avoiding accidental pay-per-token charges on personal subscriptions.
